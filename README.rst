**WORK IN PROGRESS**

pyssb - Secure Scuttlebutt in Python
====================================

Please, don't use this for anything that is not experimental. This is a first attempt at implementing the main
functionality needed to run an SSB client/server.

Things that are currently implemented:

 * Basic Message feed logic
 * Secret Handshake
 * packet-stream protocol

Usage::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Check the ``test_*.py`` files for basic examples.
